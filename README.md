# Case-Study-How-Does-a-Bike-Share-Navigate-Speedy-Success
### Analyse data about a fictional bike share company to answer - *How do annual members and casual riders use cyclistic bikes differently?* in order to make informed decisions about marketing strategies.

**The dataset that we are using has following columns**

* ride id (primary key)
* ride start time
* ride end time
* ride length (calculated)
* day of the week on which the ride was taken (calculated)
* type of biker (member/casual)
* coordiantes of the places from where the rides start and end

Task is to perform descriptive data analysis to discover an answer to the question mentioned above.

I will be sharing my findings as a presentation that will be included in the files uploaded in this repository.

Follow along as I learn EDA in python and apply it to this real world like problem :)
